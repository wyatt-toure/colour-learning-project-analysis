Welcome to the project site for the experiment described in
<span style="text-decoration:underline">'Colour biases in learned foraging
preferences in Trinidadian guppies'</span>. This site contains detailed
protocols and sample videos for the experiment as well as the code, model
outputs, data tables, and residual diagnostics for the analyses. The R markdown
scripts to reconstruct this site are available at the [GitHub repository for
this site.](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/guppy-colour-learning-project)

The goal of this project was to determine whether we could shift the preference
for particular objects in Trinidadian guppies regardless of the object's colour,
in this case we focused on green and blue. To address this we performed two
experiments where we rewarded guppies for feeding from either green or blue Lego
blocks, you can see the detailed protocol involved in performing this experiment
as well as example footage of this in the [Methods](methods.html#Tests) section.
The analysis and the code underlying this project can be found in the
[Analysis](analysis.html) section.
