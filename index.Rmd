# Background

This site contains the code, model outputs, data tables, and residual diagnostics for the analyses demonstrated in the manuscript <span style="text-decoration:underline">'Bias in the shift of foraging preference for coloured objects in Trinidadian guppies, *Poecilia reticulata*'</span>. 


The raw data used to conduct these analyses are available at the [github repository for this site](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/colour-learning-project-analysis/blob/main/data/experiment-2-master-sheet-clean.csv). 

The raw R code to produce the analysis is
available [here](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/colour-learning-project-analysis/blob/main/01-main-analysis.Rmd).
