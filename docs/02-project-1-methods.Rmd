# Project 1 â€” General Methods {#methods}

**Question**: Can I shift the preference for a particular object by reinforcing an object with a food reward. 

I had one set of guppies trained to the blue object (blue-trained guppies) and another set trained to the green object (green-trained guppies). 


I performed the following trials:

- <b> 1 baseline object preference test </b> (Guppy in tank with 1 green and 1 blue object, unrewarded)
- <b> 20 training trials </b> (Guppy in tank with 1 green and 1 blue object, rewarded for visiting one or the other based on treatment)
- <b> 1 final object preference test </b> (Guppy in tank with 1 green and 1 blue object, unrewarded)
