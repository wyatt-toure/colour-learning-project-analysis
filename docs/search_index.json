Due to heterogeneity in the variance among groups however, I switched to a generalized linear mixed model with a gaussian distribution which also modelled the vaiances to account for variance heterogeneity. My third model asks whether the preference for the rewarding object changed between baseline and final test and looks for an interaction with rewarded object colour.

Comparing the shift in rewarding object preference between initial and final preference tests in blue-trained and green-trained guppies reveals that the shift in rewarding object preference is significant for green-trained guppies but not for blue-trained guppies. Green trained guppies increased their preference for the green object by 83 seconds (going from a green object preference of 3.5 seconds initially to 86.5 seconds at final test, p &lt; .001) whereas blue-trained guppies non-significantly increased their preference for the blue object by 17.7 seconds (going from a blue object preference 1.8 seconds initially to 19.5 seconds at final test, p = 0.252).

Fish that spent more trials eating may therefore have received more reinforcement for the object-food association. This led me to perform my next test which investigated whether there was a difference in food reinforcement between the two treatments. Figure 5.1: Preference for the rewarding object during training based on whether an individual ate during a trial or not. Dashed line represents the no preference value. Data are means +/- 95% CI. Model Residuals There is a significant deviation from uniformity as indicated by the significant Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. However, this model has a particularly large sample size (n = 456) so even slight deviations will be significant. Looking at the effect size of the deviation (D = 0.0694912) shows that it is minor (D &lt; 0.1) and visual inspection does not suggest large deviations in the residuals so our model is still appropriate.

A discrepancy in reinforcement between treatments may influence performance on a final preference test. To see whether there was a difference in feeding between treatments I counted the number of trials in which an individual fish ate throughout all of training and compared the feeding counts between treatments. To do this I fit a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution. The response variable 'feeding count' is a sum of the number of trials in which a guppy ate.
