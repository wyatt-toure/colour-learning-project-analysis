Comparing the shift in rewarding object preference between initial and final preference tests in blue-trained and green-trained guppies reveals that the shift in rewarding object preference is significant for green-trained guppies but not for blue-trained guppies. Green trained guppies increased their preference for the green object by 83 seconds (going from a green object preference of 3.5 seconds initially to 86.5 seconds at final test, p &lt; .001) whereas blue-trained guppies non-significantly increased their preference for the blue object by 17.7 seconds (going from a blue object preference 1.8 seconds initially to 19.5 seconds at final test, p = 0.664). For a full description of post-hoc comparisons see table 4.1. Table 4.1: Table of post-hoc tests with a multivariate-t adjustment for multiple comparisons of a selected set of means. The numbers represent the initial test trial (0) and the final test trial (21).

["model-4-preference-for-the-rewarded-object-during-training-based-on-feeding.html", "5 Model 4 - Preference for the rewarded object during training based on feeding", " 5 Model 4 - Preference for the rewarded object during training based on feeding It might be the case that some fish behaved in a way that was not conducive to learning the association during training. My fourth model asks whether the time spent near the rewarding object during a training session is influenced by whether a fish ate or not. Here trial is a variable containing the training trials (1-20). It is supplied as a random effect along with individual ID in the model. Variables rewarding.object.preference is the time (seconds) spent near the rewarding object subtracted by the time spent near the unrewarding object ate is a binary factor (Yes or No) and corresponds to whether the fish ate in a given trial trial is the number of the training trial.

Fish that spent more trials eating may therefore have received more reinforcement for the object-food association. This led me to perform my next test which investigated whether there was a difference in food reinforcement between the two treatments. Figure 5.1: Preference for the rewarding object during training based on whether an individual ate during a trial or not. Dashed line represents the no preference value. Data are means +/- 95% CI. Model Residuals There is a significant deviation from uniformity as indicated by the significant Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. However, this model has a particularly large sample size (n = 456) so even slight deviations will be significant. Looking at the effect size of the deviation (D = 0.0694912) shows that it is minor (D &lt; 0.1) and visual inspection does not suggest large deviations in the residuals so our model is still appropriate.

A discrepancy in reinforcement between treatments may influence performance on a final preference test. To see whether there was a difference in feeding between treatments I counted the number of trials in which an individual fish ate throughout all of training and compared the feeding counts between treatments. To do this I fit a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution. The response variable 'feeding count' is a sum of the number of trials in which a guppy ate.
